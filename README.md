# Cloud Controller Manager for vSphere with Kubernetes

This project is a PoC used together with <https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-vsphere/pull/169> to manage Gardener shoot clusters on vSphere with Kubernetes ("Tanzu"). It implements a node controller to deal with worker nodes created by the Gardener machine controller manager.
